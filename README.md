theme-for-exm
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `theme-for-exm`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

* Underscore framework added.
* Branding as my own theme name.
* Deleted Jetpack file and removed from functions.php file.
* Bootstrap Support.
*

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
